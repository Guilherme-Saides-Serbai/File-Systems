## **NTFS (New Technology File System)**

### **Introduction**
- **Created by**: Microsoft
- **First Appearance**: Windows NT 3.1 (1993)
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports large volumes and files.
  - Enhanced performance and security compared to FAT.
  - Advanced features like file compression, encryption, and access control.

### **Structure**
- **MFT (Master File Table)**: Represents each file and directory with an entry.
- **Journal**: Ensures file system integrity by recording operations before execution.
- **Security**: Supports detailed permissions (ACLs - Access Control Lists) and encryption.

### **Advantages**
- Supports large files and volumes.
- Advanced data recovery and integrity features.
- Robust security with access control and encryption.

### **Disadvantages**
- Not natively compatible with older or non-Microsoft systems without additional drivers.
- More resource-intensive compared to FAT.

## **FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 (File Allocation Table)**

### **Introduction**
- **Created by**: Microsoft
- **FAT12**: Used primarily in floppy disks.
- **FAT16**: Introduced with MS-DOS 3.0 (1984).
- **FAT32**: Introduced with Windows 95 OSR2 (1996).
- **Key Features**:
  - Simple structure and widely compatible.
  - Used in smaller storage devices like floppy disks, memory cards, and flash drives.

### **Structure**
- **File Allocation Table (FAT)**: A map of used and free areas of the disk.
- **Cluster**: The basic storage unit. Each file occupies one or more clusters.
- **Root Directory**: The root directory contains information about files and subdirectories.

### **FAT12**
- **Max Volume Size**: 32 MB.
- **Cluster Size**: 12 bits.
- **Common Uses**: Floppy disks.

### **FAT16**
- **Max Volume Size**: 4 GB (with adjustments).
- **Cluster Size**: 16 bits.
- **Common Uses**: Older hard drives, memory cards.

### **FAT32**
- **Max Volume Size**: 2 TB (theoretical limit: 16 TB with 64 KB clusters).
- **Cluster Size**: 32 bits.
- **Common Uses**: Hard drives, memory cards, flash drives.

### **Advantages**
- Simple and low-resource consumption.
- Highly compatible with various operating systems and devices.

### **Disadvantages**
- File and volume size limitations (FAT12 and FAT16).
- Less secure and less efficient for data recovery compared to NTFS.
- Lacks advanced features like compression, encryption, and access control.
